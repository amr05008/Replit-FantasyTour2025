# Backup Your Fantasy Tour de France App

Since you've connected to GitHub and created "FantasyTourTrack_2025" repo, here's how to back up your current state:

## Using Replit's Version Control Interface

1. **Find the Version Control Panel**
   - Look for the branch/tree icon in your left sidebar
   - It should now show your connected GitHub repo

   - `app.py` (your main application)
   - `.streamlit/config.toml` (server config)
   - `README.md` (documentation)
   - `.gitignore` (file exclusions)
   - `dependencies.txt` (requirements)
   - `replit.md` (project context)
   - `GIT_SETUP.md` and `BACKUP_STEPS.md` (setup guides)

3. **Create Your First Commit**
   - Click the "+" button next to files you want to include (or "Stage all")
   - Add a commit message like: "Initial commit: Fantasy Tour de France app with real-time Google Sheets integration"
